Title: Automated System Shutdown Script

Objective: The objective of this project is to create a simple, user triggered batch script that automates the shutdown process of a computer.
            The script is designed to instantly shutdown the system as soon as the batch file is executed providing minimal notice to the user before forcefully terminating 
all running applications and shutting down the system.

This can be useful in specific scenarios where an immediate shutdown is necessary or for demonstration purpose.

Project Code:

@echo off
echo ===============================
echo System Shutdown
echo ===============================
echo Your computer will shutdown in 1 second...
timeout /t 1 /nobreak >nul
echo Shutting down the computer now...
shutdown /s /f /t 0
exit
